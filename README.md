# House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques

The Ames Housing dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education. It's an incredible alternative for data scientists looking for a modernized and expanded version of the often cited Boston Housing dataset. 


This project aims to predict the sale price of houses in the city of Ames in the state of Iowa, using stacked models of advanced regression techniques like Lasso Regression, Ridge, Support Vector Regression, Kernel Ridge, Elastic Net, and Bayesian Regression.
